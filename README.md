## Problem

**DeFi adoption is hindered by complex interfaces and steep learning curves.** Current crypto wallets require users to:

- Navigate unfamiliar dApp interfaces with poor UX patterns
- Manually execute transactions at specific times without built-in scheduling
- Coordinate group transactions through fragmented communication channels
- Switch between multiple applications for calendar management and crypto operations
- Learn entirely new interaction paradigms that don't leverage existing digital habits

**The result?** Millions of users who are comfortable with calendar applications remain excluded from DeFi opportunities due to technical barriers and poor user experience.

## Solution

**CalendeFi transforms any Google Calendar into a powerful, intent-based DeFi orchestration layer.**

Instead of learning new interfaces, users leverage the familiar calendar paradigm they already use daily. By simply creating calendar events with specific titles, users can:

- Execute scheduled payment intents across multiple protocols
- Connect to any dApp through WalletConnect v2 integration
- Settle USD payments via PayPal USD (PYUSD)
- Create swaps and limit orders on Uniswap DEX
- Enable multisig approval through calendar RSVP voting
- Issue ENS subnames for calendar-based identity management



**The innovation:** We've created the first intent-based calendar-native DeFi orchestration platform, making cryptocurrency operations as simple as scheduling a meeting.

## How It Works

### Calendar Event Creation & Intent Parsing
```
User creates calendar event → Google Calendar API → Payment Intent Engine
```
- **Natural Language Processing**: "Send 5 ETH to fabianferno.eth tomorrow at 2pm"
- **Intent Classification**: Determines transaction type (transfer, swap, dApp connection)
- **Parameter Extraction**: Amount, recipient, timing, approval requirements

### Multi-Protocol Intent Routing
```
Payment Intents → Protocol Router → [PayPal USD | Uniswap | WalletConnect | EVM Direct]
```

**PayPal USD Integration**
- **Fiat-Crypto Bridge**: Seamless USD settlement through PYUSD
- **Real-world Payments**: "Pay $100 to contractor@company.com"
- **Cross-border Transfers**: Instant international settlements

**Uniswap DEX Integration**
- **Automated Swaps**: "Swap 10 USDC to ETH at 3pm"
- **Limit Orders**: "Buy ETH when price drops to $2000"
- **Liquidity Management**: Scheduled LP position management

**WalletConnect v2 Integration**
- **Universal dApp Access**: Connect to any Web3 application
- **Session Management**: Persistent connections through calendar events
- **Approval Workflows**: RSVP-based connection authorization

### Scheduled Intent Execution
```
Scheduled Intents → Execution Engine → EVM Networks (Multi-chain)
```
- **Precise Timing**: Execute at exact calendar event times
- **Gas Optimization**: Dynamic gas price estimation
- **Cross-chain Support**: Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Base

### Multisig Approval via RSVP
```
Calendar Invites → RSVP Tracking → Approval Threshold → Execute/Reject
```
- **Democratic Governance**: Calendar attendees become transaction approvers
- **Flexible Thresholds**: Configurable approval percentages (50%, 66%, 100%)
- **Real-time Voting**: Live RSVP tracking with automatic execution

### ENS Identity Integration
```
Calendar Identity → ENS Subname Issuance → Decentralized Identity
```
- **Calendar-Native Identity**: Auto-generate ENS subnames for calendars
- **Human-readable Addresses**: `alice.calendefi.eth` instead of `0x742d35...`
- **Identity Persistence**: Consistent identity across sessions
